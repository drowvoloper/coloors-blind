# coloors-blind

An app inspired by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and the "Coloors project" included in the ["Creative JavaScript"](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course) course by [@developedbyed](https://twitter.com/developedbyed).

I have used [chroma.js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) for color management and the ["color-blind" module](https://github.com/skratchdot/color-blind) to generate the HEX codes for each type of color-blindness.
